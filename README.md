Project Overview:

  Hi! This was my first ever project for Python, and it is about an online store which the user has full ability to determine what items they want in what quantity.
  The goal of this project is to implement an online store in which the user is able to pick specific items, until they are satisfied.

    - Start the code
    - Add items, by typing out which item you want from the list.
    - Each item has specific qualities, which can include different varities.
    - Once added, the user can type "done"
    - The program reveals a "receipt" including tax of all items.

Project Goals:

  This function will take the user's input and determine if it is a valid item in the store menu. If the item is not correctly spelled, or incorrect in any way, the code will continue asking for a valid answer.

  Preconditions:
      - item can NOT be an integer or negative integer
      - items MUST be spelled correctly
      - "done" will give the final output

  Parameters:
      - total = total money

  Returns:
      - the total price of the shopping cart items in the customer's basket
